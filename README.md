# CloudStorageRaspberryPi
cloud storage server running on my raspberry pi 24/7, future plans: adding context search, location data with map

Roadmap
Start with basic file dashboard: upload, download, browse

Add metadata extraction: date, location, type

Add search & filtering: by metadata

Add map view: plot location metadata

Polish UI/UX: grid/gallery, responsive design, drag & drop
 
Integrate AI / context search: detect objects or faces in photos



Backend(server)
	python+fastAPI
	Store image metadata in (SQLite)

Frontend (UI)
	using Svelte for polished dashboard
